# Facebook-Network-Analysis
I did this project in 2022 august for the college course extras under the subject Mathematical Foundations for Data Science III. I have to find and upload all the files from my old laptop to github and my university exams are on so its getting delayed. But will soon update all the work done in a day or two.

# Project Description
This project involves analyzing and visualizing centrality networks in educational datasets. It also includes creating various types of random graphs that represent social networks, as well as manipulating graph and subgraph structures. These activities enable the sharing and gaining of insights into complex structures.

# Project Structure
The project was carried out according to the following steps:

Task 1: Load graphs from Excel spreadsheet files

Task 2: Visualize graphs with options and layouts

Task 3: Summarize graphs through centrality metrics

Task 4: Generate random graphs

Task 5: Add and remove nods and edges from graphs

Task 6: Manipulate nodes and edges attributes

Task 7: Create and visualize sub-graphs
