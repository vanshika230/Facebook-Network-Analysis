# Facebook-Network-Analysis

# Project Description
This project involves analyzing and visualizing centrality networks in educational datasets. It also includes creating various types of random graphs that represent social networks, as well as manipulating graph and subgraph structures. These activities enable the sharing and gaining of insights into complex structures.

# Project Structure
Work done on Social Networks Dataset.

The project was carried out according to the following steps:

Task 1: Load graphs from Excel spreadsheet files

Task 2: Visualize graphs with options and layouts

Task 3: Summarize graphs through centrality metrics

Task 4: Create and visualize sub-graphs

Learning NetworkX

1) Generate random graphs

2) Add and remove nods and edges from graphs

3) Manipulate nodes and edges attributes
